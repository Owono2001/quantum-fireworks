## ‚ú® Core Features

* **üåå Real-time 3D Rendering:** Watch vibrant fireworks explode and fade in a 3D space (e.g., using WebGL/Canvas).
* **üéÆ Interactive GUI Controls:** Fine-tune simulation parameters like gravity, particle lifespan, explosion characteristics, color palettes, and more via an intuitive graphical interface.
* **üí® Physics-Based Simulation:** Particles are influenced by simulated gravity, air resistance, and potentially other forces for realistic motion.
* **üåä Fluid Dynamics Inspiration:** Smoke trails and explosion patterns draw inspiration from fluid dynamics principles for more organic visuals.
* **üß¨ Genetic Algorithm Driven Evolution:** Discover unique firework types as the simulation uses genetic algorithms to evolve and combine characteristics over time.
* **üé® Multiple Firework Types:** Features various classic firework styles (like Peony, Chrysanthemum) alongside algorithmically generated novel types.
* **üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Camera:** (Optional - add if you have it) Control the viewpoint to observe the fireworks from different angles.

## üî¨ Core Concepts Explained

* **Particle System:** The foundation of the simulation. Each firework burst releases thousands of particles, each with properties like position, velocity, color, and lifespan, updated each frame.
* **Fluid Dynamics (Simplified):** While not a full fluid simulation, visual elements like smoke dissipation and burst shapes mimic fluid behavior using techniques like noise fields or specific particle movement rules.
* **Genetic Algorithms:** Used to create variety. Firework properties (color, burst pattern, timing) are encoded like 'genes'. New fireworks can be 'bred' by combining and slightly mutating the properties of successful previous ones, leading to an evolving display.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Rendering:** [Specify: e.g., Plain Canvas API, p5.js, Three.js, etc.]
* **GUI:** [Specify: e.g., dat.GUI, lil-gui, Tweakpane, custom]
* **(Other Libraries):** [e.g., Noise functions library, Vector math library, etc.]
